                  Safe Motherhood Foundation was established by Dr Joe Adejo. 
                  This vision was borne out of pain and anguish over the devastating
                  effect of maternal mortality and new born morbidity.<br><br>
                  Safe Motherhood Foundation is a family Focused NGO set up to bring 
                  maternal mortality and child morbidity to zero tolerance level, also to 
                  restore unity and maintain peace in families fostering a healthy society 
                  and a harmonious community.  <br><br>
                  Our research has proven that maternal mortality, child morbidity 
                  and family discord are due to ignorance and not knowing God. <br><br>
                  The steps begin with handling of the teenage girls, before marriage, 
                  preconception, prenatal, through gestation, delivery and post-partum.<br><br>
                  Our goal is to build a culture of cleanliness, healthy living producing 
                  a healthy woman, healthy pregnancy, and a healthy child.<br><br>
                  A wholesome woman is protected from preventable needless death; this is why 
                  our core mission is building a wholesome woman by equipping her with practical 
                  knowledge, economic power through our empowerment programs and hands on training.<br><br>
                  Through our experience and research we have created educational materials to 
                  bring people to the knowledge of God and His desire concerning living a healthy 
                  life by addressing health and maternal health from conception to postpartum without 
                  complication, with scriptural and medical references written in Hausa language and 
                  English language. One of our missions is to get these materials to every home in the 
                  Northern States of Nigeria as records show high rates of maternal mortality and child 
                  morbidity in these areas.<br><br>
